  abstract = {In dialectology we often encounter irreducible variation in its data, i.e., multiple responses to its probes about the form of a word or phrase. Dialectometry seeks to measure the differences between dialects and has developed several ways to measure the difference between responses when one or both of them is non-unique. We introduce here BILBAO DISTANCE, where the cardinality of response is unimportant, which may be combined with various weighting functions such as edit distance or inverse frequency weighting, and which yields intuitively appealing measures, e.g., when applied to a singleton set \{a\} and a set with the same element plus a second, yields d(\{a\},\{a,b\}) = 0.5. It overcomes flaws in earlier proposals and is conceptually simpler and computationally more efficient to apply than earlier measures. We suspect that its results satisfy the metric axioms, as it is certainly symmetric and measures the difference between identical sets as zero.},

  abstract = {Gabmap is a freely available, open-source web application that analyzes the data of language variation, e.g. varying words for the same concepts, varying pronunciations for the same words, or varying frequencies of syntactic constructions in transcribed conversations. Gabmap is an integrated part of CLARIN (see e.g. http://portal.clarin.nl). This article summarizes Gabmap's basic functionality, adding material on some new features and reporting on the range of uses to which Gabmap has been put. Gabmap is modestly successful, and its popularity underscores the fact that the study of language variation has crossed a watershed concerning the acceptability of automated language analysis. Automated analysis not only improves researchers' efficiency, it also improves the replicability of their analyses and allows them to focus on inferences to be drawn from analyses and other more abstract aspects of that study.},

  abstract = {Gabmap2 is a web application aimed especially to facilitate explorations in quantitative dialectology \textendash or dialectometry \textendash{} by enabling researchers in dialectology to conduct computer-supported explorations and calculations even if they have relatively little computational expertise. Gabmap creates various views of dialect data, from histograms of characters used to spot coding errors, to alignments of phonetic transcriptions used in measuring pronunciation distance, to colored multi-dimensional scaling plots intended to illustrate quantitative results insightfully. Many analyses are accompanied by facilities allowing researchers to probe further, e.g. seeking the most important linguistic bases of an areal division, or examining the results of clustering for statistical reliability. These are also intended to inform the critical discussion of quantitative techniques, i.e. a comparision between quantitative analyses and non-quantitative (qualitative) work. For this reason Gabmap also includes support for qualitative analyses, such as facilities to map the occurrence of individual features. The software is in use, and the source code is openly available.},

  abstract = {The primary data on pronunciation variation \textendash{} e.g., dialect atlas data \textendash{} is often recorded incommensurably, i.e. in different ways in different atlases, and even in different ways within the same atlas when teams of fieldworkers and transcribers are involved. In particular these data collections differ in the detail in which pronunciations are recorded, using between 40 and 100 different basic symbols. This study shows that transcription system detail (understood in this sense) increases the linguistic distance measured and therefore must be regarded as a source of bias in assessing pronunciation differences and comparing them across languages. A method is therefore introduced to reduce transcription system complexity, even while retaining faithful assessments of aggregate pronunciation differences. The technique introduced is relevant when comparing within sets that have been transcribed very differently and also when comparing different dialectological datasets, e.g. with respect to the dependence of linguistic difference on geography.},
